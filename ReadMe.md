# 📊 Credit Scoring Bias Detection Prototype

## 📝 Overview
This project investigates **algorithmic bias** in credit scoring systems.  
We aim to:
1. Analyze dataset(s) for potential bias against protected groups (e.g., race, gender, age).
2. Train and evaluate machine learning models.
3. Measure **accuracy** and **fairness** metrics.
4. Apply **bias mitigation** techniques and compare results.

This repository contains:
- Data loading and preprocessing scripts.
- Notebooks for exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
- Utilities to measure and mitigate algorithmic bias.
